Please right-click unetbootin and click "Open".
You may get a warning that the developer is unidentified; just click "Open".

If you do not see an option to launch the application, try repeating the process -
on macOS Catalina it will only let you launch the application the second time you try.

If no window appears, minimize all other applications -
it may have appeared in the background.
